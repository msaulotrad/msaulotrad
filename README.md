- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Milagros Saulo.
- I'm a freelance English <> Latam Spanish translator and localization specialist from Argentina.
- I've been working in the field for about 2 years. I've mainly focused on medical translation and the localization of video games.
- My experience has allowed me to train and acquire valuable skills such as in-depth research of concepts and terminology, organization, and creativity.
- I have experience working with CAT Tools (Phrase TMS, MemoQ, Trados Studio). I also have a thorough understanding of computers, so I can easily learn to use new software if requested.
- ðŸ“« You can contact me on [Skype](https://join.skype.com/invite/fO6a2xsA2NjF), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/msaulotrad/?locale=en_US), or just send me and [email](mailto:msaulotrad@gmail.com).
